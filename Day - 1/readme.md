## Day 1

<p align="center">
This is the first day of the JavaScript Course.
Today I Have Learned Syntax, Types of Languages, Comments and Variables
</p>

## Syntax

Just like there are some set of rules for writing a sentence in English, there are some set of rules for writing a program in a programming language. These rules are called syntax. Syntax is how a program is written and arranged. It defines the combination of symbols that are considered to be correctly structured.

## Type of Language

**Dynamically Typed**
- Dynamically typed languages are the ones where the type of a variable is determined at runtime. 
- This means that the type of a variable can change during the execution of the program. 
- Js is example of a dynamically typed language.

**Statically Typed**
- Statically typed languages are the ones where the type of a variable is determined at compile time. 
- This means that the type of a variable cannot change during the execution of the program. 
- C is example of a statically typed language.

## Comments

**Single Line Comments**
```
// This is a single line comment
```

**Multi-Line Comments**
```
/*
This is 
a multi-line 
comment.
*/
```

## Variables

- Variables are used to store data. 
- Variables are used to store different types of data. 
- javascript is a dynamically typed language, the type of data that can be stored in a variable can change during the execution of the program.
