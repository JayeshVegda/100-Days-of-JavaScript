## Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical calculations. Here are the most common arithmetic operators in JavaScript:

|Operator	|Description	|Example|
| ----- | ---| --------------------------------|
|+	|Addition	|3 + 5 evaluates to 8|
|-	|Subtraction	|7 - 2 evaluates to 5|
|*	|Multiplication	|4 * 6 evaluates to 24|
|/	|Division	|12 / 4 evaluates to 3|
|%	|Modulus	|10 % 3 evaluates to 1|
|**	|Exponentiation	|2 ** 3 evaluates to 8|

## Exponential operator
|Operator	|Description	|Example|
| ----- | ---| --------------------------------|
|+=	|Addition assignment	|a += b is the same as a = a + b|
|-=	|Subtraction assignment	|a -= b is the same as a = a - b|
|*=	|Multiplication assignment	|a *= b is the same as a = a * b|
|/=	|Division assignment	|a /= b is the same as a = a / b|
|%=	|Modulus assignment	|a %= b is the same as a = a % b|


## Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used to compare two values and return a Boolean value (true or false) depending on whether the comparison is true or false. Here are the most common comparison operators in JavaScript:


|Operator	|Description	|Example|
| ----- | ---| --------------------------------|
|==	|Equal to	|5 == 5 evaluates to true|
|===	|Strict equal to	|5 === "5" evaluates to false|
|!=	|Not equal to	|5 != 4 evaluates to true|
|!==	|Strict not equal to|	5 !== "5" evaluates to true|
|>	|Greater than	|6 > 4 evaluates to true|
|<	|Less than	|6 < 4 evaluates to false|
|>=	|Greater than or equal to	|6 >= 6 evaluates to true|
|<=	|Less than or equal to	|6 <= 4 evaluates to false|


## Logical Operators

|Operator	|Description	|Example|
| ----- | ---| --------------------------------|
|&&	|Logical AND. Returns true if both operands are true, otherwise false.	|true && true evaluates to true|
| //| Logical OR. Returns true if at least one of the operands is true, otherwise false.	| true // false evaluates to true |
|!	|Logical NOT. Returns the opposite of the operand. If it's true, it returns false. If it's false, it returns true.	|!true evaluates to false|
