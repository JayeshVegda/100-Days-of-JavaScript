Topic : Data Types

## Primitive Data Types
In JavaScript, there are 7 primitive data types. The primitive data types are fundamental data types that are built into JavaScript. A good trick to remember these 7 data types is ***"NNSSBBU"***:

- N - null
- N - number
- S - symbol
- S - string
- B - boolean
- B - bigint
- U - undefined

## Objects
Other than the 7 primitive data types, the non-primitive data type in JavaScript is the object. Objects are key-value pairs, used to map keys to values. We can create an object like this:

```
const bioData = {
	name: "Jay",
	age: 19,
	likesJS: true,
	secret: undefined,
};
```
